# hello-world

Hello everyone,

I am a recent graduate from SNHU, and currently looking into careers in software development.  I found an interest in coding in High School while taking classes in both C++ and Java, and took a few more programming classes in college.  I have a wife and two daughters and currently work at one of Amazon's fullfillment warehouses in Chester, Virginia.  I hope to gain more insight and experience to help with my transition into the tech world.
